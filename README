Ideas for improvements:

* Learn how to write good rust docs
* [RLE] General storage method (i.e. a simple byte stream, not a vec of enum members)
* [RLE] Concatenate adjacent literals.
* Other (better) compression algorithms.
* ~~Split out algorithmic code into modules.~~
* ~~[RLE] Handle both runs and literals (i.e. only encode a run if it has a certain number of repeats).~~
